# Secure-File-Transfer
Implemented a secure client-server file transfer system using AES-GCM for confidentiality and integrity, with timestamping, sequence numbering, and SHA-256 hashing to prevent tampering, injection, deletion, and replay attacks. Used a hybrid RSA-AES encryption scheme to securely establish symmetric keys over insecure networks.
